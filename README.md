# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

# Introduction
This project aims to analyse customer churn within a bank using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualisation.
My interest in analysing customer churn comes from its direct impact on business profitability, particularly in competitive industries such as banking. 
This project allowed me to explore data-driven solutions to this common problem, helping businesses retain valuable customers through tailored solutions.
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and consists of various demographic, financial, and customer-related factors that influence churn.
The focus of the analysis is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and offer recommendations for reducing churn rates.

# Data
The dataset contains customer data from a bank, with key fields such as:

- Geography (Customerâ€™s location)
- Gender
- Age
- Balance
- Number of products bought
- Tenure with the bank
- Credit score
- Whether the customer has exited (churned)
- Analysis and Insights

# Main Findings:
- Geography and Churn- Customers from Germany have a higher churn rate compared to other countries. This may suggest that German customers require more attention and personalized retention strategies.
- Gender and Churn- Females are more likely to churn, especially in Germany. Offering personalized products and services could help reduce churn in this group.
- Age and Churn- Customers aged between 51-70 are the most likely to churn, while those over 70 are the least likely. The bank may need to introduce retirement-related products or provide financial advisory services for the older demographic.
- Balance and Churn- Customers with higher balances (especially in Germany) are more likely to churn. This finding is interesting, as one would expect customers with higher balances to stay with the bank. Retention strategies such as offering better interest rates or loyalty bonuses may help mitigate this.
- Number of Products and Churn- Customers with more products tend to churn more often. Offering loyalty rewards or discounts for multiple products could help improve retention.
- Tenure and Product Purchases- There is no significant correlation between tenure and the number of products purchased, so tenure may not be a strong indicator for product-related insights.

# Suggested Improvements:
- Since customers with higher balances tend to churn, the bank could engage them with more personalized benefits or low-risk investment opportunities.
- Develop specific programs aimed at reducing churn in demographics most likely to exit, such as older customers (51-70 years old) or German customers.
- Creating personalised offers for female customers and bundling products with better incentives could help in retention.
- Collaborating with local banks in Germany or offering more competitive rates compared to local banks may reduce churn.

Tableau Dashboard
A Tableau dashboard has been created to provide visual insights into customer churn. It includes visualisations on:

- Churn rates by geography, gender, and age group.
- Ranking of demographics by churn likelihood.
- Analysis of balance and its relationship to churn.

# Conclusion
This project analyses customer churn within the banking sector, focusing on geographic, gender, and financial factors.
The findings reveal that German and French females are at the highest risk of churn, with German customers holding significantly higher average balances, making them a priority for retention.
According to the data, that customers aged 35-55 hold the largest balances, while older customers (over 60) show higher churn rates as their balances decline.
These insights suggest that implementing retention strategies that target gender and geography, notably in Germany and France,
as well as offering personalised products to high-balance and older customers, could significantly reduce churn and improve profitability.
